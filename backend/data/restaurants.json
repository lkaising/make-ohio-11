The lamb shank entree I ordered was expertly prepared, with the lamb cooked to perfection, possessing a delicate flavor profile, and a tender, moist texture. The accompanying rice was cooked to perfection and seasoned judiciously, with a generous portion provided. The vegetables were also noteworthy. The service was attentive, with my meal arriving quickly, hot, and freshly prepared.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",

The parking is a bit tricky in their lot but there's street parking available. The restaurant is usually lively and busy, but it's welcoming.\n\nThere's a self serve station for plates, utensils, seasonings, and water!\nWe usually get a couple entrees to share and you really can't go wrong with anything. They also have platter options for groups and their portions are decently sized and filling.\nI really enjoy their lamb and beef options, they're flavorful and made well. Their hummus is absolutely delicious, I recommend! I also liked their spicy potato side dish, it was very good. I also recommend their spiced chai, it's warm, flavorful, and sweet.\nOverall, you can't go wrong and you'll be back to try it all.\n\nStaff is always kind, always helpful, and they'll take care of you!\nI recommend them for groups, casual date, tasty food, and a good experience! Have been back many times and will continue to come back.",

We can wait to go back to try the spring menu, we will most definitely be doing the chefs whim menu again. Drew was our server he was fantastic and knowledgeable on the menu offerings.

I’m not quite sure what it was missing, but that X factor just wasn’t there for me. They do an incredible job however, and the taste, texture and look of the food is very high end.\n\nSomething I was disappointed in however, was the restaurant’s ambience.

It was the kind of weird you get when people try a little too hard to be creative... The creamy custard with the umami broth and apples plus mushrooms was not a good pairing. This shouldn't even be on the menu.\n\nFor dessert, we had the apple cheesecake and that was forgettable.\n\nI question whether I'd want to ever come back to this restaurant.

She is Vegan and there are many options around that cater, however I was looking for something that we could walk to and intimate. 'plas was the perfect location. We did the vegan formaggio board which was a meal in itself. However, I was eying the 'Chef's Whim' as it could be made entirely vegan. 5 courses, all shown in the pictures. We split that and as she says, it was some of the best food she has ever had. We also did a drink pairing with it which was phenomenal. This was a late Tuesday night, so we nearly had the restaurant to ourselves which just made the experience over the top. It truly felt like we had a private dinner experience. Only the meatball was the on menu vegan item that the chef prepared, which was fantastic. However, everything else was superb. I try to take my wife to places that have good vegan options, but we don't have as much in the Cleveland area. Not to this level. So I am glad we went with the Whim because it was just a surprise the whole night, with nothing short of perfection. The entire staff was excellent and we cannot wait to come back! The food courses were 1) spring roll, 2) vegan sashimi, 3) chickn meatball, savory crepes (our favorite), and a fruit desert.",

I was gonna walk away and try something else when she finally asked what I’d like to have . Other wise good experience",

Wish the schmear of burrata could have been more heavy handed, but the pickled red onions on top really cuts through the richness of the cheese as a welcome addition.  The broth that enrobed the dumplings was phenomenal and the veggies especially the mushrooms were blanched to perfection, but the dumplings themselves were a bit too al dente for me.

They assisted us with finding a table when we booked a reservation incorrectly.The restaurant decor was nice. The food was good as well. The Buffalo Chicken Dip was an 8/10. I would give the Cripsy Chicken Sandwich (Nashville Hot Chicken Style) a 7/10. I liked the sauce but the chicken itself wasn’t very well seasoned, though it was nicely cooked. The fries were an 8/10 with a good balance of crispiness and flavor. The Moscow Mule was also an 8/10. The taste was good. I didn’t feel as much of a buzz as I usually do with a mule, but that could have been due to me drinking my cocktail a little slower than usual. I would order the drink again.\n\nA few critiques are that they were out of white wine and therefore couldn’t make a drink one of my friends was interested in. They also switched the vibe of the restaurant around 10 o’clock. It took on more of a bar/club scene. Staff stationed themselves at the door and began checking people’s I.D.’s prior to entry and a DJ started playing really loud music that made it difficult to hear one another as we talked at our table. This wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. The DJ sounded good. It just wasn’t the setting we were looking for. It would have been nice if the staff would have communicated this switch to us a few minutes prior or when we arrived, so we’d have a heads up.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my visit and I would return.",

They are consistently out of about half the beers on the menu, the wings are considerably less tasty (& less saucy) than they used to be, and the portion amount of the truffle fries side item is almost half the amount as it used to be even just last summer 2024. I don't know what has happened since then, but it's definitely become kind of a bummer to come here. Prices have gone up too; which obviously is understandable, but the quality and amount are declining...Gotta find a new half-off wing/beer place. Sad to say that because we used to love this place.",

We ordered bluefin tuna nigiri, a bento box, crispy rice, plum wine, yellowtail crudo and Berkshire tonkatsu. Everything exceeding our expectations. The owner even came over and checked on us a few times. We were so impressed with the service as well. Our waiter, Austin, was so lovely and patient.

I walked into the establishment and was immediately greeted by one of the servers. She brought out a physical menu, but she also clarified that if I scanned the QR code on the table, I would have access to the forming which had all the items in the drinks.\n\nI noticed there was a sign posted about happy hour, which takes place from 4 PM to 7 PM, and then again from 10 PM to midnight. Please navigate to the images to see a picture of the lemon drop cocktail. The cocktail was OK, but I’ve definitely had better. However, for the price I was pretty satisfied.\n\nI decided to try the white queso dip, which was very good with an authentic flavor. The dip was also pretty spicy, so I am assuming there are some type of hot peppers or jalapeños in the recipe.\n\nThe Carne Asada taco was OK but I wish the steak had a little more flavor. The fried chicken taco with the side chipotle sauce was okay as well, but again both tacos  needed more flavor. My bill came up to around $25 which I felt was very reasonable.\n\nThe overall ambience was pretty chill, and there was nice music playing in the background.

The breakfast pizza was exactly what I wanted out of a pizza for breakfast. The chicken and waffles are the perfect level of savory and sweet. Lastly, the starter of crispy rice was phenomenal: they are not stingy with thw tuna. And if it's your birthday don't forget to let them know. Not our first time here and definitely not our last.",

Food is average, and some dishes were lacking flavor, but overall it was still good. Also the portions could be a bit bigger (mainly the salads and proteins).

Before that we visited Forno many times and had pleasant experiences. However this time the experience was very very bad . We ordered Arancini’s and Roasted Garlic Shrimp. While Roasted Garlic Shrimp was good the Arancini was not. The sauce was very tart.  Having spoiled the taste we decided to move on but the server was nowhere to be seen. We tried to get the attention of reception but the ladies there were busy talking among themselves for more than 15 mins. Finally we as well as other table had to request another server to get our server. When the server got the check we saw they had added a line item called Transaction cost. When I asked them what this was they said it’s a cost for using credit card when I protested the server said they always had it and everyone in Short north charges it . I told her that’s not true . This is first time I saw someone in. Columbus directly pass on the credit charges to customer. It’s said that a restaurant where I used to take my family friend and visitors has reached this level . Will definitely think twice before recommending this place in future.\n\nI have attached photos of two associates who kept talking and did not see our or the other table customers signaling for attention.\n\nI have also attached the bill from the adjoining restaurant to see if they directly charge the credit card fees and you will notice they don’t. I was so enraged I forgot to pick up the Forno bill else I would have posted its pic too",

We ordered the Cajun chicken pasta, crab cake, lobster tacos, empanadas, salmon bites, and fried rice. The drinks were great as well. Everything was amazing! At the end of dinner, Dan brought out a surprise slice of cake for my friend, which was also delicious. I loved the vibe and will definitely be back!",

There were some weird vibes from someone working the bar who told us that all of the appetizers were half off, which isn’t true since we’d seen the lineup on the website before coming in, then when the bill came he charged full price for one of the ones we’d ordered that was half off…we just felt like he was trying to pull a fast one, but good experience other than that!\n\nWe ordered the wagyu sliders (so good!), butter beef Vietnamese summer rolls (the beef was so good and the flavor was amazing), and bang bang shrimp (good with a little spicy kick, but wish they were a tiny bit less fried).",

        "text": "I came here for dinner on a Sunday evening and it felt pretty laid-back and informal. It has a classy ambiance, but it's in the hotel lobby and not really separated from guests coming and going. We sat ourselves and most people there were just grabbing drinks from the bar. There was a wide variety of attire, so you definitely don't need to come dressed formally. I wouldn't call it a nice date night vibe, but mostly focused on elevated cuisine. The menu is okay, not super extensive or exciting, but the food was excellent. For starters, the pretzel bites had a unique texture to them -- reminded me a tiny bit of a yeast donut but a little thicker. The salmon entree was phenomenal -- delicious glaze, great crust on the salmon, silky smooth and rich puree, everything on the plate meshed well together.. 9/10 dish. I tasted a bite of the mushroom risotto and it was quite good, too. Service was good. I'd come back for another great meal.",

Things were moving slow as would be expected, but it seemed like the entire staff from bartenders, to servers, to management were hustling to the best of their ability. When food and cocktails  reached us it was well prepared and a manager named Patrick stopped by to talk to us for a few minutes to explain and apologize. He seemed sincere and kind even though I saw a few guests being rude to him when he tried to explain the same things to them. As someone who has worked in service I really think a host would have been helpful as we all just sat at once and flooded our orders into the bar and kitchen?",

We went for happy hour ( sun-tue, 5-7 pm) for the great prices on both drinks and appetizers. We started off with pretzel bites. They came with a type of mustard and cheese sauce. They weren’t fresh, but still really good. Even though they don’t have it listed, they do have a veggie patty to substitute to all the burgers if you just ask. I ordered a Moda Burger, both it and the fries it came with were delicious! After happy hour ended we ordered one more drink and I went with an holiday spritz. It was perfect! Our server was great and extremely attentive.",

Service was very friendly and attentive, but could have been improved with some simple accommodations. E.g., my wife wasn't able to get a cup of coffee, because they didn't want to make a fresh pot in the afternoon, and I was denied the addition of a fried egg on my burger because \"the breakfast stuff had already been put away.\" I found this odd, that a simple egg could not be found in the kitchen. In the end, I must say, I really didn't need the egg, as the burger was fabulous as provided! I would definitely go back for the food, and shoot for a bit earlier next time to try the brunch menu.",
