The lamb shank entree I ordered was expertly prepared, with the lamb cooked to perfection, possessing a delicate flavor profile, and a tender, moist texture. The accompanying rice was cooked to perfection and seasoned judiciously, with a generous portion provided. The vegetables were also noteworthy. The service was attentive, with my meal arriving quickly, hot, and freshly prepared.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",

The parking is a bit tricky in their lot but there's street parking available. The restaurant is usually lively and busy, but it's welcoming.\n\nThere's a self serve station for plates, utensils, seasonings, and water!\nWe usually get a couple entrees to share and you really can't go wrong with anything. They also have platter options for groups and their portions are decently sized and filling.\nI really enjoy their lamb and beef options, they're flavorful and made well. Their hummus is absolutely delicious, I recommend! I also liked their spicy potato side dish, it was very good. I also recommend their spiced chai, it's warm, flavorful, and sweet.\nOverall, you can't go wrong and you'll be back to try it all.\n\nStaff is always kind, always helpful, and they'll take care of you!\nI recommend them for groups, casual date, tasty food, and a good experience! Have been back many times and will continue to come back.",

We can wait to go back to try the spring menu, we will most definitely be doing the chefs whim menu again. Drew was our server he was fantastic and knowledgeable on the menu offerings.

I’m not quite sure what it was missing, but that X factor just wasn’t there for me. They do an incredible job however, and the taste, texture and look of the food is very high end.\n\nSomething I was disappointed in however, was the restaurant’s ambience.

I love duck, and I really enjoyed how it was prepared here.\n\nI decided to order the panna cotta appetizer since I've never had panna cotta in a savory dish - it was weird. It was the kind of weird you get when people try a little too hard to be creative... The creamy custard with the umami broth and apples plus mushrooms was not a good pairing. This shouldn't even be on the menu.\n\nFor dessert, we had the apple cheesecake and that was forgettable.\n\nI question whether I'd want to ever come back to this restaurant.

She is Vegan and there are many options around that cater, however I was looking for something that we could walk to and intimate. 'plas was the perfect location. We did the vegan formaggio board which was a meal in itself. However, I was eying the 'Chef's Whim' as it could be made entirely vegan. 5 courses, all shown in the pictures. We split that and as she says, it was some of the best food she has ever had. We also did a drink pairing with it which was phenomenal. This was a late Tuesday night, so we nearly had the restaurant to ourselves which just made the experience over the top. It truly felt like we had a private dinner experience. Only the meatball was the on menu vegan item that the chef prepared, which was fantastic. However, everything else was superb. I try to take my wife to places that have good vegan options, but we don't have as much in the Cleveland area. Not to this level. So I am glad we went with the Whim because it was just a surprise the whole night, with nothing short of perfection. The entire staff was excellent and we cannot wait to come back! The food courses were 1) spring roll, 2) vegan sashimi, 3) chickn meatball, savory crepes (our favorite), and a fruit desert.",

The Downtown scene has changed significantly for the better and this restaurant is definitely a gem on top of an onslaught of pretty decent other options. Had the burrata on top of toast. Wish the schmear of burrata could have been more heavy handed, but the pickled red onions on top really cuts through the richness of the cheese as a welcome addition.  The broth that enrobed the dumplings was phenomenal and the veggies especially the mushrooms were blanched to perfection, but the dumplings themselves were a bit too al dente for me.

        "text": "I visited Bodega on a Saturday night with friends. The staff were friendly and attentive. They assisted us with finding a table when we booked a reservation incorrectly.The restaurant decor was nice. The food was good as well. The Buffalo Chicken Dip was an 8/10. I would give the Cripsy Chicken Sandwich (Nashville Hot Chicken Style) a 7/10. I liked the sauce but the chicken itself wasn’t very well seasoned, though it was nicely cooked. The fries were an 8/10 with a good balance of crispiness and flavor. The Moscow Mule was also an 8/10. The taste was good. I didn’t feel as much of a buzz as I usually do with a mule, but that could have been due to me drinking my cocktail a little slower than usual. I would order the drink again.\n\nA few critiques are that they were out of white wine and therefore couldn’t make a drink one of my friends was interested in. They also switched the vibe of the restaurant around 10 o’clock. It took on more of a bar/club scene. Staff stationed themselves at the door and began checking people’s I.D.’s prior to entry and a DJ started playing really loud music that made it difficult to hear one another as we talked at our table. This wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. The DJ sounded good. It just wasn’t the setting we were looking for. It would have been nice if the staff would have communicated this switch to us a few minutes prior or when we arrived, so we’d have a heads up.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my visit and I would return.",

They are consistently out of about half the beers on the menu, the wings are considerably less tasty (& less saucy) than they used to be, and the portion amount of the truffle fries side item is almost half the amount as it used to be even just last summer 2024. I don't know what has happened since then, but it's definitely become kind of a bummer to come here. Prices have gone up too; which obviously is understandable, but the quality and amount are declining...Gotta find a new half-off wing/beer place. Sad to say that because we used to love this place.",

We ordered bluefin tuna nigiri, a bento box, crispy rice, plum wine, yellowtail crudo and Berkshire tonkatsu. Everything exceeding our expectations. The owner even came over and checked on us a few times. We were so impressed with the service as well. Our waiter, Austin, was so lovely and patient.

I walked into the establishment and was immediately greeted by one of the servers. She brought out a physical menu, but she also clarified that if I scanned the QR code on the table, I would have access to the forming which had all the items in the drinks.\n\nI noticed there was a sign posted about happy hour, which takes place from 4 PM to 7 PM, and then again from 10 PM to midnight. Please navigate to the images to see a picture of the lemon drop cocktail. The cocktail was OK, but I’ve definitely had better. However, for the price I was pretty satisfied.\n\nI decided to try the white queso dip, which was very good with an authentic flavor. The dip was also pretty spicy, so I am assuming there are some type of hot peppers or jalapeños in the recipe.\n\nThe Carne Asada taco was OK but I wish the steak had a little more flavor. The fried chicken taco with the side chipotle sauce was okay as well, but again both tacos  needed more flavor. My bill came up to around $25 which I felt was very reasonable.\n\nThe overall ambience was pretty chill, and there was nice music playing in the background.

The breakfast pizza was exactly what I wanted out of a pizza for breakfast. The chicken and waffles are the perfect level of savory and sweet. Lastly, the starter of crispy rice was phenomenal: they are not stingy with thw tuna. And if it's your birthday don't forget to let them know. Not our first time here and definitely not our last.",

Before that we visited Forno many times and had pleasant experiences. However this time the experience was very very bad . We ordered Arancini’s and Roasted Garlic Shrimp. While Roasted Garlic Shrimp was good the Arancini was not. The sauce was very tart.  Having spoiled the taste we decided to move on but the server was nowhere to be seen. We tried to get the attention of reception but the ladies there were busy talking among themselves for more than 15 mins. Finally we as well as other table had to request another server to get our server. When the server got the check we saw they had added a line item called Transaction cost. When I asked them what this was they said it’s a cost for using credit card when I protested the server said they always had it and everyone in Short north charges it . I told her that’s not true . This is first time I saw someone in. Columbus directly pass on the credit charges to customer. It’s said that a restaurant where I used to take my family friend and visitors has reached this level . Will definitely think twice before recommending this place in future.\n\nI have attached photos of two associates who kept talking and did not see our or the other table customers signaling for attention.\n\nI have also attached the bill from the adjoining restaurant to see if they directly charge the credit card fees and you will notice they don’t. I was so enraged I forgot to pick up the Forno bill else I would have posted its pic too",

It has a classy ambiance, but it's in the hotel lobby and not really separated from guests coming and going. We sat ourselves and most people there were just grabbing drinks from the bar. There was a wide variety of attire, so you definitely don't need to come dressed formally. I wouldn't call it a nice date night vibe, but mostly focused on elevated cuisine. The menu is okay, not super extensive or exciting, but the food was excellent. For starters, the pretzel bites had a unique texture to them -- reminded me a tiny bit of a yeast donut but a little thicker. The salmon entree was phenomenal -- delicious glaze, great crust on the salmon, silky smooth and rich puree, everything on the plate meshed well together.. 9/10 dish. I tasted a bite of the mushroom risotto and it was quite good, too. Service was good. I'd come back for another great meal.",

He seemed sincere and kind even though I saw a few guests being rude to him when he tried to explain the same things to them.

Service was very friendly and attentive, but could have been improved with some simple accommodations. E.g., my wife wasn't able to get a cup of coffee, because they didn't want to make a fresh pot in the afternoon, and I was denied the addition of a fried egg on my burger because \"the breakfast stuff had already been put away.\" I found this odd, that a simple egg could not be found in the kitchen. In the end, I must say, I really didn't need the egg, as the burger was fabulous as provided! I would definitely go back for the food, and shoot for a bit earlier next time to try the brunch menu.",

At over $115 per person, the portions were laughably small, with the only generously sized dish being the ganache cheesecake—an odd contrast to the rest of the meal. While some dishes, like the risotto, truffle bruschetta, and pesto gnocchi, were flavorful, the overall tasting menu failed to deliver the balance of quality and portion expected from a fine dining experience. The classic parmesan pasta tossed in a parmesan wheel was visually impressive but overwhelmingly salty and pungent. The salad, which seemed more like a palette cleanser, was nothing more than a few arugula leaves, some citrus chunks and tiny anchovy slivers, making it an noticeably underwhelming course. The mocktails, despite their premium price, were unimpressive—one tasted like a basic lemon soda, and the other was a bland carbonated orange drink. Service, while friendly, was slow, with long gaps between courses that disrupted the dining flow. The establishment was cozy but a little loud between patron chatter. To make matters worse, our group, which does not eat pork, was served tortellini with prosciutto, requiring a return (we informed before the meal started of no pork items). The lack of protein across the board made the meal feel incomplete, and ultimately, we left unsatisfied and feeling overcharged. Despite the kind staff, the overall experience was underwhelming, and we won’t be returning.",

Portion sizes are not large but not so small that a 3 course meal isn’t enough, though if you’re hungrier I’d recommend the 4 course option. The waiters do a full menu run-through before you order so you know how everything is prepared (I.e. what all of the Italian words are) which is great so you don’t have to ask or secretly google anything. The staff are all super nice and the hostess that night (who might be the owner?) is from Italy and knows a lot about the wine list which is an impressive selection of Italian glasses from all throughout Italy (I was particularly surprised about how many options there were from less common Italian regions, white wines in particular).

The restaurant is in an older building with exposed brick and a nice, small-ish dining room with tasteful art on the walls.  The kitchen is open, which is always a plus.  We were greeted on arrival (nice lady from Bologna), and seated promptly for our reservation.\n\nOur waiter was very good - knew the menu well, had his pronunciation down, and was not intrusive in handling the table.\n\nService and aesthetics aside, the dining room was a bit chilly.  Even walking through towards the kitchen, there wasn't a lot of temperature change.\n\nYou are guided to a three-course meal and strongly encouraged to not go a la carte.  Some of the \"add ons\" were pushed a bit.  Know that a bottle of water will be $7.50,  and the focaccia (three small strips of focaccia with a tomato  paste on top and [unsure why] some olive oil to dip) is $8.50.\n\nThe meal was significantly overpriced for what it was.  My wife's Tortellini in Brodo had four tortellini and about an ounce of broth on them.  My Risotto dell'Inverno had maybe five spoonfuls of risotto and was out in under ten minutes.  The Carbonara served was equally about ten bites of a tubetti-type pasta with a few not-very-crisp pieces of guanciale on top.\n\nDessert-wise, my panna cotta was OK, I ended up eating only the panna cotta itself and not the bizarre mixture of spiced smear of something, differently spiced crumbles, and oddly spiced whipped cream dots on the plate.  The tiramisu that came to the table was unique in that it was served in a moka pot, but was otherwise marginal.   My wife's Il Gioiello dell'Inverno was marginal at best.  Finally, expect a $4 espresso if you want to cap the dinner off.\n\nA three course \"meal\" (a tiny antipasti, pasta, and a desert) , glass of wine, two bottles of water, a blood orange soda, and facaccia coming to just over $225 should not have you walking away hungry.  I guess I am grateful that they bill themselves as an \"osteria\" instead of a \"ristorante\" as the bill would have been significantly higher.\n\nSave your self a significant amount of money, this is just not worth it.",

        "text": "Your classic Korean fried chicken with so many options to choose from! Great flavor, crispy and good value for what you pay. For some reason they had the place so hot inside during winter. The service was great and the place was not very busy for a weekend time. Was nice to see they had a bar area and served alcohol since it wasn’t super clear online. Always get a Sapporo draft and it was refreshing as usual. We tried the honey garlic and Gangnam style wings and both tasted great. I wish I could give them 4.5*, just wish it wasn’t as hot and they had happy hour or drink specials to checkout! I really hope they make it here as this is a difficult location. Will have to try tiger sugar Nextdoor for drinks next time.",

        "text": "1st time dining in, it was secluded and comfy with really good hot fresh chicken. Right across from CVS so i run my errands then sit n relax. Even the service is friendly and warm. About $15 but the chicken by itself is worth it, It came with white pickle radish which was yummy yummy and  free drink refills. Left satisfied with food leftover for dinner later.",

        "text": "I visited with a friend for dinner on a Saturday night. I would rate the  service as a 5/5 as the waitress and management were very attentive. I would give the food a 3.5/ 5 as the amount of food my friend got with their meal was not great for the price, and while my food tasted okay and my portion was plentiful, it didn’t taste amazing. My drink was a 3.5/5 as the presentation was nice but it seemed to be low on alcohol. My cake was a 4/5 as it was moist and flavorful. The ambiance was a 5/5 as the restaurant was beautifully decorated and great for photos. Overall, if you are interested in visiting this restaurant, I’d say give it a try.",

        "text": "First time here for a date night and decor of this place is amazing! The service was great. It was a slow night which worked in our favor.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and consistently available. We started off with the devils eggs they were good not amazing but good. I had the chophouse punch and I didn’t care for it. I also had the firecracker sushi which was definitely delicious!! Very impressive and it was beautifully plated. My wife had the filet steak and she a bit disappointed that it had little to no flavor but was cooked to her liking. The mashed potatoes with added lobster was enjoyable. The brussels sprouts surprisingly were extremely flavorful and like nothing I’ve tasted before and I’ve tried some and definitely wasn’t a fan but they’ve made me one of theirs for sure!  We were consistently checked on throughout our meal and the clean up as we finished one dish was impressive. This is definitely a place you want to look nice and take many pictures. The overall experience here was definitely delightful. We will be back!",

        "text": "So I know this review might be confusing, because my wife and I had a fairly good time. Let's start with the atmosphere looking more like a club, than an actual restaurant.  Accompanied with pop music that you would find at a club. We were seated at a high table (even tho I reserved outside seating). I should've pushed for what I requested, as you will read about later. When we walked into the restaurant, the 1st thing that I noticed was some groups brought there kids. Now mind you, the average cost for an entree is around 40 dollars per plate. Once seated, my wife and I noticed one group, who allowed their toddler to jump and run around one of the booths. This booth happened to be right next to our table. With pricing between 30 to 60 dollars per plate, I was quite confused on why the staff allowed those to take place. At any rate, our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful on drinks and food. Although we enjoyed our meal, while celebrating our wedding anniversary, we couldn't get over the toddler constantly running and jumping on the booth next to us. And the craziest part was when that group finally decided to leave, they were replaced with another group coming in, celebrating their 1 year olds birthday. The combined anesthetics of this restaurant is not children friendly, nor should it be.\n\nSantos should require an age restriction and parents should keepbtjere children in check. I didn't spend 250.00 on a meal to be interrupted by a lack of babysitting. Other than that, the food was excellent.",

Nothing exactly wrong but not anything they’d order again.\n\nWhile some of us were disappointed in the food, all of us had a great experience and would try other items next time. At the end of the meal our server brought over complimentary strawberry Jell-O shots because we were celebrating a birthday. It was a fun surprise and we appreciated the extra effort. The staff made us feel so welcome.",
