The lamb shank entree I ordered was expertly prepared, with the lamb cooked to perfection, possessing a delicate flavor profile, and a tender, moist texture. The accompanying rice was cooked to perfection and seasoned judiciously, with a generous portion provided. The vegetables were also noteworthy. The service was attentive, with my meal arriving quickly, hot, and freshly prepared.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",

The parking is a bit tricky in their lot but there's street parking available. The restaurant is usually lively and busy, but it's welcoming.\n\nThere's a self serve station for plates, utensils, seasonings, and water!\nWe usually get a couple entrees to share and you really can't go wrong with anything. They also have platter options for groups and their portions are decently sized and filling.\nI really enjoy their lamb and beef options, they're flavorful and made well. Their hummus is absolutely delicious, I recommend! I also liked their spicy potato side dish, it was very good. I also recommend their spiced chai, it's warm, flavorful, and sweet.\nOverall, you can't go wrong and you'll be back to try it all.\n\nStaff is always kind, always helpful, and they'll take care of you!\nI recommend them for groups, casual date, tasty food, and a good experience! Have been back many times and will continue to come back.",

It was the kind of weird you get when people try a little too hard to be creative... The creamy custard with the umami broth and apples plus mushrooms was not a good pairing. This shouldn't even be on the menu.\n\nFor dessert, we had the apple cheesecake and that was forgettable.\n\nI question whether I'd want to ever come back to this restaurant.

She is Vegan and there are many options around that cater, however I was looking for something that we could walk to and intimate. 'plas was the perfect location. We did the vegan formaggio board which was a meal in itself. However, I was eying the 'Chef's Whim' as it could be made entirely vegan. 5 courses, all shown in the pictures. We split that and as she says, it was some of the best food she has ever had. We also did a drink pairing with it which was phenomenal. This was a late Tuesday night, so we nearly had the restaurant to ourselves which just made the experience over the top. It truly felt like we had a private dinner experience. Only the meatball was the on menu vegan item that the chef prepared, which was fantastic. However, everything else was superb. I try to take my wife to places that have good vegan options, but we don't have as much in the Cleveland area. Not to this level. So I am glad we went with the Whim because it was just a surprise the whole night, with nothing short of perfection. The entire staff was excellent and we cannot wait to come back! The food courses were 1) spring roll, 2) vegan sashimi, 3) chickn meatball, savory crepes (our favorite), and a fruit desert.",

They assisted us with finding a table when we booked a reservation incorrectly.The restaurant decor was nice. The food was good as well. The Buffalo Chicken Dip was an 8/10. I would give the Cripsy Chicken Sandwich (Nashville Hot Chicken Style) a 7/10. I liked the sauce but the chicken itself wasn’t very well seasoned, though it was nicely cooked. The fries were an 8/10 with a good balance of crispiness and flavor. The Moscow Mule was also an 8/10. The taste was good. I didn’t feel as much of a buzz as I usually do with a mule, but that could have been due to me drinking my cocktail a little slower than usual. I would order the drink again.\n\nA few critiques are that they were out of white wine and therefore couldn’t make a drink one of my friends was interested in. They also switched the vibe of the restaurant around 10 o’clock. It took on more of a bar/club scene. Staff stationed themselves at the door and began checking people’s I.D.’s prior to entry and a DJ started playing really loud music that made it difficult to hear one another as we talked at our table. This wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. The DJ sounded good. It just wasn’t the setting we were looking for. It would have been nice if the staff would have communicated this switch to us a few minutes prior or when we arrived, so we’d have a heads up.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my visit and I would return.",

They are consistently out of about half the beers on the menu, the wings are considerably less tasty (& less saucy) than they used to be, and the portion amount of the truffle fries side item is almost half the amount as it used to be even just last summer 2024. I don't know what has happened since then, but it's definitely become kind of a bummer to come here. Prices have gone up too; which obviously is understandable, but the quality and amount are declining...Gotta find a new half-off wing/beer place. Sad to say that because we used to love this place.",

We ordered bluefin tuna nigiri, a bento box, crispy rice, plum wine, yellowtail crudo and Berkshire tonkatsu. Everything exceeding our expectations. The owner even came over and checked on us a few times. We were so impressed with the service as well. Our waiter, Austin, was so lovely and patient.

I walked into the establishment and was immediately greeted by one of the servers. She brought out a physical menu, but she also clarified that if I scanned the QR code on the table, I would have access to the forming which had all the items in the drinks.\n\nI noticed there was a sign posted about happy hour, which takes place from 4 PM to 7 PM, and then again from 10 PM to midnight. Please navigate to the images to see a picture of the lemon drop cocktail. The cocktail was OK, but I’ve definitely had better. However, for the price I was pretty satisfied.\n\nI decided to try the white queso dip, which was very good with an authentic flavor. The dip was also pretty spicy, so I am assuming there are some type of hot peppers or jalapeños in the recipe.\n\nThe Carne Asada taco was OK but I wish the steak had a little more flavor. The fried chicken taco with the side chipotle sauce was okay as well, but again both tacos  needed more flavor. My bill came up to around $25 which I felt was very reasonable.\n\nThe overall ambience was pretty chill, and there was nice music playing in the background. I am definitely returning to give this establishment another go around I would highly recommend coming and checking it out for yourself, especially on a Tuesday evening!",

Before that we visited Forno many times and had pleasant experiences. However this time the experience was very very bad . We ordered Arancini’s and Roasted Garlic Shrimp. While Roasted Garlic Shrimp was good the Arancini was not. The sauce was very tart.  Having spoiled the taste we decided to move on but the server was nowhere to be seen. We tried to get the attention of reception but the ladies there were busy talking among themselves for more than 15 mins. Finally we as well as other table had to request another server to get our server. When the server got the check we saw they had added a line item called Transaction cost. When I asked them what this was they said it’s a cost for using credit card when I protested the server said they always had it and everyone in Short north charges it . I told her that’s not true . This is first time I saw someone in. Columbus directly pass on the credit charges to customer. It’s said that a restaurant where I used to take my family friend and visitors has reached this level . Will definitely think twice before recommending this place in future.\n\nI have attached photos of two associates who kept talking and did not see our or the other table customers signaling for attention.\n\nI have also attached the bill from the adjoining restaurant to see if they directly charge the credit card fees and you will notice they don’t. I was so enraged I forgot to pick up the Forno bill else I would have posted its pic too",

It has a classy ambiance, but it's in the hotel lobby and not really separated from guests coming and going. We sat ourselves and most people there were just grabbing drinks from the bar. There was a wide variety of attire, so you definitely don't need to come dressed formally. I wouldn't call it a nice date night vibe, but mostly focused on elevated cuisine. The menu is okay, not super extensive or exciting, but the food was excellent. For starters, the pretzel bites had a unique texture to them -- reminded me a tiny bit of a yeast donut but a little thicker. The salmon entree was phenomenal -- delicious glaze, great crust on the salmon, silky smooth and rich puree, everything on the plate meshed well together.. 9/10 dish. I tasted a bite of the mushroom risotto and it was quite good, too. Service was good. I'd come back for another great meal.",

Things were moving slow as would be expected, but it seemed like the entire staff from bartenders, to servers, to management were hustling to the best of their ability. When food and cocktails  reached us it was well prepared and a manager named Patrick stopped by to talk to us for a few minutes to explain and apologize. He seemed sincere and kind even though I saw a few guests being rude to him when he tried to explain the same things to them.

At over $115 per person, the portions were laughably small, with the only generously sized dish being the ganache cheesecake—an odd contrast to the rest of the meal. While some dishes, like the risotto, truffle bruschetta, and pesto gnocchi, were flavorful, the overall tasting menu failed to deliver the balance of quality and portion expected from a fine dining experience. The classic parmesan pasta tossed in a parmesan wheel was visually impressive but overwhelmingly salty and pungent. The salad, which seemed more like a palette cleanser, was nothing more than a few arugula leaves, some citrus chunks and tiny anchovy slivers, making it an noticeably underwhelming course. The mocktails, despite their premium price, were unimpressive—one tasted like a basic lemon soda, and the other was a bland carbonated orange drink. Service, while friendly, was slow, with long gaps between courses that disrupted the dining flow. The establishment was cozy but a little loud between patron chatter. To make matters worse, our group, which does not eat pork, was served tortellini with prosciutto, requiring a return (we informed before the meal started of no pork items). The lack of protein across the board made the meal feel incomplete, and ultimately, we left unsatisfied and feeling overcharged. Despite the kind staff, the overall experience was underwhelming, and we won’t be returning.",

Portion sizes are not large but not so small that a 3 course meal isn’t enough, though if you’re hungrier I’d recommend the 4 course option. The waiters do a full menu run-through before you order so you know how everything is prepared (I.e. what all of the Italian words are) which is great so you don’t have to ask or secretly google anything. The staff are all super nice and the hostess that night (who might be the owner?) is from Italy and knows a lot about the wine list which is an impressive selection of Italian glasses from all throughout Italy (I was particularly surprised about how many options there were from less common Italian regions, white wines in particular). I will definitely be returning to try more menu items and wines!",

The restaurant is in an older building with exposed brick and a nice, small-ish dining room with tasteful art on the walls.  The kitchen is open, which is always a plus.  We were greeted on arrival (nice lady from Bologna), and seated promptly for our reservation.\n\nOur waiter was very good - knew the menu well, had his pronunciation down, and was not intrusive in handling the table.\n\nService and aesthetics aside, the dining room was a bit chilly.  Even walking through towards the kitchen, there wasn't a lot of temperature change.\n\nYou are guided to a three-course meal and strongly encouraged to not go a la carte.  Some of the \"add ons\" were pushed a bit.  Know that a bottle of water will be $7.50,  and the focaccia (three small strips of focaccia with a tomato  paste on top and [unsure why] some olive oil to dip) is $8.50.\n\nThe meal was significantly overpriced for what it was.  My wife's Tortellini in Brodo had four tortellini and about an ounce of broth on them.  My Risotto dell'Inverno had maybe five spoonfuls of risotto and was out in under ten minutes.  The Carbonara served was equally about ten bites of a tubetti-type pasta with a few not-very-crisp pieces of guanciale on top.\n\nDessert-wise, my panna cotta was OK, I ended up eating only the panna cotta itself and not the bizarre mixture of spiced smear of something, differently spiced crumbles, and oddly spiced whipped cream dots on the plate.  The tiramisu that came to the table was unique in that it was served in a moka pot, but was otherwise marginal.   My wife's Il Gioiello dell'Inverno was marginal at best.  Finally, expect a $4 espresso if you want to cap the dinner off.\n\nA three course \"meal\" (a tiny antipasti, pasta, and a desert) , glass of wine, two bottles of water, a blood orange soda, and facaccia coming to just over $225 should not have you walking away hungry.  I guess I am grateful that they bill themselves as an \"osteria\" instead of a \"ristorante\" as the bill would have been significantly higher.\n\nSave your self a significant amount of money, this is just not worth it.",

Ramen tastes great with a half boiled egg and authentic spicy broth, but it tastes like the instant ramen noodles from Asian groceries. Sushi rice is hot, which could be cooled. I like their rices more than noodles. Anyway, the lunch special coming with a Ramen and a set of Sushi cost less than $15.",

Service was very friendly and attentive, but could have been improved with some simple accommodations. E.g., my wife wasn't able to get a cup of coffee, because they didn't want to make a fresh pot in the afternoon, and I was denied the addition of a fried egg on my burger because \"the breakfast stuff had already been put away.\" I found this odd, that a simple egg could not be found in the kitchen. In the end, I must say, I really didn't need the egg, as the burger was fabulous as provided! I would definitely go back for the food, and shoot for a bit earlier next time to try the brunch menu.",

For some reason they had the place so hot inside during winter. The service was great and the place was not very busy for a weekend time. Was nice to see they had a bar area and served alcohol since it wasn’t super clear online. Always get a Sapporo draft and it was refreshing as usual. We tried the honey garlic and Gangnam style wings and both tasted great. I wish I could give them 4.5*, just wish it wasn’t as hot and they had happy hour or drink specials to checkout!

I also had the firecracker sushi which was definitely delicious!! Very impressive and it was beautifully plated. My wife had the filet steak and she a bit disappointed that it had little to no flavor but was cooked to her liking. The mashed potatoes with added lobster was enjoyable. The brussels sprouts surprisingly were extremely flavorful and like nothing I’ve tasted before and I’ve tried some and definitely wasn’t a fan but they’ve made me one of theirs for sure!  We were consistently checked on throughout our meal and the clean up as we finished one dish was impressive. This is definitely a place you want to look nice and take many pictures.

Accompanied with pop music that you would find at a club. We were seated at a high table (even tho I reserved outside seating). I should've pushed for what I requested, as you will read about later. When we walked into the restaurant, the 1st thing that I noticed was some groups brought there kids. Now mind you, the average cost for an entree is around 40 dollars per plate. Once seated, my wife and I noticed one group, who allowed their toddler to jump and run around one of the booths. This booth happened to be right next to our table. With pricing between 30 to 60 dollars per plate, I was quite confused on why the staff allowed those to take place. At any rate, our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful on drinks and food. Although we enjoyed our meal, while celebrating our wedding anniversary, we couldn't get over the toddler constantly running and jumping on the booth next to us. And the craziest part was when that group finally decided to leave, they were replaced with another group coming in, celebrating their 1 year olds birthday. The combined anesthetics of this restaurant is not children friendly, nor should it be.\n\nSantos should require an age restriction and parents should keepbtjere children in check. I didn't spend 250.00 on a meal to be interrupted by a lack of babysitting. Other than that, the food was excellent.",

I’m usually iffy about eating fish, but after hearing that their Red Snapper taco is “the best fish taco in Ohio” I had to try it and boy, am I glad I did. I cannot stop talking about how delicious the red snapper taco is. I love the fact that they bread the fish which gives it a crunchy texture and makes the taco 1000x more delicious. I originally got 1 asada taco and 1 red snapper but after eating, I had to order another snapper. The asada taco is good as well, especially the salsa on top of it. When I go back to Budds, I won’t be able to try anything else. The food is a little pricey, it was $36 just for my food and two drinks, but if the food is that delicious it might just be worth it.",

The portion size is large for the price you pay so I feel like you get a good value.  Easy enough to share a 12” quesadilla for two.  The quesadilla was good.  It was anything unique and tasted fine.  It had some cheese that must fall out during cooking and gets cooked to quesadilla.  Overall was just good",

        "text": "This location on campus has a few accessible features to it, but while visiting the inside, I noticed some areas that could be upgraded to make it even more accessible. A few things I had noticed upon entering is there are two separate entrances, one with a handicap button and one without, and either way you enter, the doors are made of wood and seem to be fairly heavy for someone in a wheelchair. With the entrance that has the handicap button on the outside, the button seems to be a decent size to press for someone, but the door tends to only stay open for 3-5 seconds. This seems to be a short timeframe, in my opinion, as it may take longer for frequent users of the handicap button to get through the doors. I did not see a handicap button inside the doors, while leaving the establishment.\nThere are no ramps or stairs which does make the area a bit more accessible, and along with this there is a variety of seating inside (booths, tables, comfortable chairs, etc.) and at all different heights as well. This makes things a bit easier for anyone with a disability and gives a wide selection of choices for all people who eat there. However, I noticed there are lots of tables in the side rooms that are within 3 feet or less of each other, and with chairs not pushed in, this creates barriers for any wheelchair users or blind individuals.\nI will say, most of the countertops are at a great height for reaching and grabbing everything you may need (cups, ordering off the iPad at the front, and sauces), but if you are placing a to-go order, the shelves that the food is placed on for those orders tend to become too high to reach for your food whenever it is ready. Also, they do have screens located up above behind the counter that shows when your food is being prepared and when it is ready which is helpful for any deaf or HOH individuals to follow along with when needed.\nOverall, this location does a good job at keeping some factors in mind for individuals with a disability, but there could always be upgrades and changes to make the establishment even more comfortable for those individuals!",

The brisket on top of the tots and nachos was excellent. I never imagined BBQ sauce and nachos could make such a good combo. Both dishes were overloaded with good stuff!.. I don't know how else to put it. The hush puppies were excellent, too. The cinnamon roll was a 6/10 for me; twas a little crunchier than I'd like. All the main dishes on our table looked amazing, and generally, everybody was happy. I had the brisket and eggs, which wasn't as flavourful and exciting as the starters, but still a solid meal.

The seasonal pancakes were the best I’ve ever had. How do you get that perfect cinnamon crunch on them? I also got the hoe Benny and a side salad. The Benny was phenomenal. The pickled onions shot a plain side salad out of this world. Whoever designed this menu knows simplicity , love, and what makes breakfast the perfect meal of the day. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, it’s been a while since door dash brought me anything other than average. This restaurant put my faith back in ordering out. I WILL be ordering, again. Do yourself a favor and don’t skip over this place.",

Nicole was a fantastic server and was very knowledgeable in the menu and gave great recommendations. We had never been here before, but we will definitely be back. They need places like this in Lexington Kentucky. (Where we’re from.) I got the chicken and waffles and my boyfriend got the smothered and covered. Both were delicious and come out within at least 10 minutes of us ordering. I cannot rave enough about this place! Thankyou Hangover Easy for an amazing breakfast experience!!!!",

This spot is a true gem for anyone looking to enjoy a hearty and delicious meal in a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nThe ambiance is cozy and laid-back, with eclectic décor that adds a fun touch to the dining experience. It’s the perfect place to unwind with friends or family, whether you’re grabbing breakfast after a night out or just looking for a great place to start your day.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the food—it’s absolutely phenomenal! 🍳🥞 The menu is packed with creative twists on classic breakfast and brunch favorites. I tried their signature “Hangover Hash,” and it was nothing short of amazing. The portions are generous, and every bite is bursting with flavor. My friends ordered the “Pancake Balls” and the “Dirty Sanchez” burrito, and they couldn’t stop raving about how good everything was.\n\nOne thing that really stood out is their commitment to accommodating different dietary preferences. There are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, so everyone can find something they’ll love.\n\nThe drinks are also a highlight. Whether you’re in the mood for a strong cup of coffee ☕ or a refreshing mimosa 🍾, they’ve got you covered. Their creative cocktail menu adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the meal.\n\nThe service was top-notch. The staff were friendly, attentive, and genuinely seemed to enjoy being there. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and offered great recommendations.\n\nOverall, Hangovereasy is a fantastic place to enjoy delicious food in a welcoming environment. It’s become one of my favorite spots in Columbus, and I highly recommend giving it a try. Whether you’re a local or just passing through, this place is definitely worth a visit!\n\nCan’t wait to go back!",

The first 2 times were carryout.  The third time I ate my tacos at the bar.\n\nThe food was consistent each time. They are meaty tacos with fresh topping and house made sauces.\n\nMy favorite is the Carnitas. The shredded pork was very flavorful.\nThe chicken is marinated and fork-tender. Good flavor.\nThe chorizo is a solid choice as well. Fairly mild and should please those looking for a sometime like a regular American taco.\n\nThe salsas are fresh and chunky. The hot has a good smokey kick. The jalapeño sauce is flavorful and has a good heat as well.\n\nThe service is pretty quick for being a 1, occasionally, 2 man operation. Small kitchen and is kept clean.\nKate and The Owner are both nice people and care about the quality of food and customer experience.\n\nParking, outside of peak bar hours, isn't bad, but if you are taking part in Brew-Stirs activities,  you may need to park in the other nearby lot.\n\nNOTE: I recommend dining in for first experience.  Soft tacos travel well but loose heat very quickly. I still enjoyed my carryout orders but I made sure to eat there and experience tacos right from the kitchen.",

The egg roll was disappointing and small. The crab rangoon was pretty good. The Szechwan beef was pretty good but not what i was expecting. It was almost like soup with beef and kimchi. The sweet and sour i liked the flavor of, however i wish they did the sweet n sour sauce on the side for takeout. It caused the chicken to not be crispy. However they do make the good sweet n sour that has the peppers and onions. There might have been pineapple in the sauce but I didn't see any chunks in my portion. Overall a solid place, i think a 4-4.5* is pretty accurate based on what i ate. Thanks guys!",

My order was verified and ready when I got there. The spicy shrimp lo mein was very good, not dry like recent lo mein that I've had, also not too spicy where you can't enjoy it. The Sesame chicken was so tasty, it not like you're standard ball of chicken that's fried, where you may get more batter than chicken, it's more chicken then breading and I really appreciate that. The Sesame sauce is more like there own kind of BBQ sauce as they stated in the menu. Overall a very good experience and the best part was the EGG ROLL !!!!!

Then the chicken hibachi came out and I enjoyed it at first, until I found an eyelash in my food. I know for some people they are able to continue eating their food but this just really grossed me out. I told the waitress very quietly and politely and she just responded with oh I am sorry. I didnt hear anything from her about it after which I was disappointed about because most restaurants would let you know they have told the staff or cooks or are remaking your food. Finally, towards the end of dinner, flies began flying all around our table. I counted about 5 or 6 flying around my seat.\nOverall, I was very let down by the experience especially after being so excited to try for the first time.",

From the moment you walk in, the warm, rustic ambiance sets the tone for a fantastic dining experience. The dim lighting, exposed brick, and communal seating create an inviting and laid-back atmosphere that makes you want to stay awhile.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the star of the show—the pizza. Simply put, it’s phenomenal. Their wood-fired pies have the perfect balance of crispy-yet-chewy crust, rich tomato sauce, and high-quality toppings that elevate every bite. Whether you’re a classic pepperoni fan or love adventurous combinations, there’s something on the menu for everyone. I love the Cheese Square.\n\nService was equally impressive. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive without being overbearing. They were happy to offer recommendations and made sure our drinks were always topped off.\n\nPaulie Gee’s isn’t just a pizza joint—it’s an experience. Whether you’re out for a casual dinner or a fun night with friends, this spot delivers on all fronts. If you haven’t been yet, do yourself a favor and grab a slice (or a whole pie) ASAP.",

Its chefs kiss perfect. It has good structure but also gives a little and has good ratio with toppings. Wood fired adds a delightful taste and crisp.\n\nOne of the people I dined with got a deep dish and I was very impressed with this as well- super crispy cheese on the edges, and well incredible. I’m not sure if I’ll do a deep dish or a traditional next time\nBecause they are both so good.\n\nThe only criticism I’d say is we ordered the Caesar salad and it really was quite spicy and I didn’t expect it. I wish they had more sides and maybe even a dessert menu but they do pizza extremely well so I’m glad they at least do that and offer a lot of variety in terms of toppings and crust type!\n\nI’ve heard to get the true deliciousness you should done in and not take this to go! I’ll be thinking about this pizza for a long time!\n\n3/2/24: weeks came back a second time.

First off, the *Regina Pizza* basically kicked down the door to my taste buds and threw a pizza party. The mozzarella? Stretchier than my gym routine. The sauce? So fresh, it might’ve just been tomatoes living their best life five minutes ago.\n\nNow, about the pepperoni—these little guys were curled up like they were sunbathing on the beach, collecting all that savory, greasy goodness like tiny meat chalices sent from the heavens. I may or may not have wept a little when I took my first bite. Don’t judge me.\n\nThen there’s the crust. I’m convinced this dough is the result of some ancient pizza magic passed down through the ages. Crispy outside, chewy inside, like it’s doing a perfect yoga pose. Honestly, if I could legally marry this crust, I would’ve already sent out the invitations.\n\nFinal verdict: 9.8/10. Why not 10?

The n/a was really good and had a great cherry quality without being too simple.\n\nFood:\n\nGot brussels sprouts, bread, and market fish which was halibut.\n\nThe brussels was very well done - perfect texture and well balanced with sweet and acidity. The skins were not mushy or overdone, but weren't underdone as if gnawing on uncooked roots. Very good.\n\nBread - butter was red onion and jam I think was a seasonal fall profile like a spiced apple butter. I highly recommend this dish. It's extremely well done.\n\nMy fish dish was absolutely fantastic. It comes with spinach and yoghurt and pistachio. This dish was absolutely astounding. The only item for improvement was portion size - a halibut for nearly 40 bucks I recommend a larger portion size. Luckily, my fellow diner had way too much food so I finished off their fries.\n\nFellow diner got the kb burger. While the flavor was good (I didnt try, just relaying), ingredients resulted in a product far too wet and ended up being visibly soggy even to me. I saw the bread moosh up so they recommended doing a more solid cheese and sticking to onion instead of onion jam.\n\nThe fries were good, but definitely on the salty side.\n\nDefinitely expensive but they certainly take pride in their work.

Still the best ramen in Columbus!\n\nThe best ramen place is Columbus but unfortunately they are going to close very soon. I have tried vegetarian ramen at many restaurants in Columbus and none of those places come anywhere close to this place in taste. The broth was very flavourful and creamy. Cannot recommend this place enough to all the ramen lovers. My wife does not like ramen but even she liked this place. I hope that they sell this place to people who would run it well.

I appreciate how the food is served at a lower height which is greatly accommodating to wheelchair users, but the seating options in the largest dining place are difficult to maneuver around because of how closer together the tables and seats are, which allows for maximum seating options but does not really account for individuals in wheelchairs. On a positive note, I feel that the sensory environment is not too overwhelming at certain hours because the music is kept low and the area is kept clean but the large amount of people present at peak hours can be very overstimulating. Menus are up high above the food stations and can be difficult to read for people with visual impairments so I feel that they could do better at providing braille labels closer to the food rather than one larger menu off to the side.

This one is from the famed Darden Restaurants company that operates the Long Horn and Olive Garden chains.\nThe Capital Grille has a higher price point than Long Horn. The ambience is luxuriously attractive with a wine rack room encased in glass, dark wood, burgundy colors, mood lighting and white tablecloths.  We came here to try their dry aged steak which tastes amazing and perfectly cooked to your temperature.  We also ordered their famous wagyu burger, which is a pretty good deal paired with great wine and sides. We allowed their manager and chef to order for us their top sides and desserts to go with our steak and burger, and they were excellent (see pics for more).  Great selection of wines.\nOverall, a great place to dine especially for a celebration, birthday, romantic dinner or after office get together.\nThe have valet but there is plenty of parking.  The service was quick and the staff very attentive.  Highly recommended!",

I made the reservation online and just added a little note that said that it would be our first time there and that it was our anniversary.  They had a table beautifully decorated with little heart confetti, a single long-stemmed red rose, and a card. They also brought out a champagne 🍾 toast for us, which was lovely. We ordered delicious drinks (I had an amaretto sour and he had the blackberry side car) and for an appetizer we had the lobster and crabcake, it was by far the best we've ever had and highly recommend it! Our meals were yummy and cooked to perfection 🤌 I had the strip, he had the veal and we shared the Creamed corn with bacon and augratin potatoes.  They also had a bread basket with ample varieties included.  We ended with the anniversary creme brulee topped with fresh berries and it was outstanding! Our waiter was Anthony and he was so kind, engaging,  and responsive-we couldn't have asked for a better anniversary dinner. ❤️ Thank you The Capital Grille! We can't wait to come back.",

Someone in my party asked if the rose bouquet, that was on display in the middle of the restaurant, was real because he is a flower lover. Next thing you know, Jordan came back with a rose for me and one for him. We were blown away! This was an amazing experience!",

Lots of dark wood with a slightly masculine vibe, it is nicely decorated. (You would NEVER know this is the old Champs restaurant)!! The crab cakes were DIVINE!!! The steak, one of the best I've had in a long time! Every year, we usually host this large dinner at Hyde Park but decided to try Capital Grille instead this time and many of the guests said they enjoyed the experience MORE than Hyde Park!!! We'll certainly be returning for our annual dinner next year and I'll be visiting at some point myself before then!! Definitely check it out if you haven't already!",

It was for Sunday Afternoon so even though we switched reservation times, they still had our table ready and we were the only people there besides a few at the bar(it was NFC/AFC championship night). Our waitress was super friendly and explained everything that was asked. Amazing ambiance, perfect for their midnight club scene.  All of the food took a very long time to come out, but when it did, it was delicious and hot. As i previously said, it was AFC/NFC night so i give the chef a brake, there was most likely only one and we ordered 7 plates. I had the salmon, which was super tender 8.3/10. I will post the rest of the food my family had, they all said it was pretty good. You’re really paying for the location and ambiance. As a restaurant, it’s not bad, but I would personally go elsewhere. If you want a drink or a quick bite with a small group and you’re in the area, I would recommend it.\nParking is tricky, i recommend rides share if possible. The parking spots behind the building are for UDF, with a few unlabeled spots, but they seem like tow-away traps. First come first serve parking on E 1st Ave.",

Everything was so good and our server katie was the best! The only downside 4 us was how loud the music was. We came here 2 catch up with our friend who was in town 4 business and we are road tripping so we decided 2 meet up. Dinner & drinks sounded good but didn't know we would be eating while the music was loud enough that we felt like we were at the club. If this was 20 yrs ago we woulda been cool, but as we are old in our 40s we did not like it. It's a college town tho so we get it. Other than that guys please check this place out!",

We tryed the Chicken Tenders with fries, Chicken & Manchego Dip, Short Rib Bao buns, Veggie Fried rice and the Spicy Tuna poppers. Something was off with the fried rice, it a little sour taste to it that tastes like lime. The Short Rib bao buns were ok.The spicy tuna were ok, I think it was just a texture thing for me. The hand breaded tenders and Chicken dip were our favorite. The portion sizes for the happy hour has to be one of the best portion sizes we've had and they didn't skimp on them even though it was happy hour. We also tried a few of the cocktails which were, the Watermelon Margarita, the Lotus and the bubbles & berries. As well as three of the happy hour maragritas which were all refreshing. I HIGHLY recommend the Galla Park Social, the server and staff was very attentive. I can't wait till our next visit!!!",

The lunch portion fajitas were good and a good portion.\n\nThe chicken tenders and fries caused me angst.\nThey charge a $4 up charge for anyone over 12 getting the same portion of food- this always blows me away. I asked the server and he told me he would ring it at the 7.95 under 12 price. I told him we were prepared to leave as I wasn't paying $4 more since they didn't offer a hi Ken tenders appetizer for my son who doesn't enjoy Mexican fare. We could have and should have just left, but he confidently indicated it was not big deal, \"I got you\". We ordered and enjoyed some of the chips and salsa provided. We also had water to drink.\n\nWhen they brought the chicken tenders and fries I was suprised by what I saw. They literally cut a tender in half and we got 2 chicken tenders and fries, and as you can see from the inside, little chicken inside. 🤯 my mind was blown 😂 we laughed and decided to just eat and we could grab my son something in the way home if he was still hungry.\n\nThen the bill came and the server didn't have me, as you can see it was charged as the price with $4 more. After a long discussion with him (he tried to say maybe it was the service fee that was different 3% service charge for using a credit card! I explained that the record shows the cost of $4 more and 3% of $100 would only be $3 so that couldn't be it...the manager came over and he explained the policy and how he doesn't set prices. I explained that I understood, but we were going to leave until the server told us he would just charge the $7.95.\n\nThe manager didn't know how to refund the bill to correct, had to call someone, ended up reprinting the record and took my card again. The server came over and said he did it right, must have been the POS...um no - the machine doesn't know how old someone is...\n\nJust own it dude. Ultimately, I am waiting to see when the credit occurs, they did not provide me with a credit slip and there are 2 charges on my credit card as of today.\n\nI don't think we will be back.",

Third and Hollywood has a very cozy, dimly lit vibe that is great for celebrating a special occasion, date nights, happy hour and as we recently found out the best brunch in the 614!\n\nHaving long been on a quest to find the best cinnamon roll in Columbus, we have finally found it! As a vegetarian my go-to dish is the vegetarian mixed grill. A common mistake restaurants make with vegetarian/vegan dishes is not making it filling/hearty enough but I always come home with leftovers here! The artichoke hearts are another staple dish here that can not be missed.",

There was a set menu which our server told us we could not alter (when I made the reservation, no such set menu was mentioned). My glass of wine took at least 10 minutes to arrive. My appetizer was the only highlight of the meal, but while I was looking outside at the snow, the server took it away before I had finished without asking. A few moments later she returned to check on our meals (which arrived as we were still working on the first course) and we asked if she was boxing up the appetizer since I still had about a quarter of it left.  She said no, but fortunately it is on their every day menu so we can come back any time and have it again.  She did not offer to bring another even though we reminded her that I had not yet finished it. There was a large chunk of melon in my husband's Caesar salad, which she said it not normal.  Dinner was less than satisfactory, but having both worked in the restaurant industry for years, we did not complain because it was still edible.  We overheard the server near our section describing featured items on the menu as well as informing other diners that if there was an item not listed on tonight's set menu that they really had their hearts set on, they could still order that (our server told us the set menu was our only option).  Overall, we were very displeased with our first experience here and will not return.  As alums, we had high hopes for The Blackwell Bistro based on pictures from the website and the viewable menu.  Unfortunately, we left disappointed and ended up ordering a pizza after we returned home.",

Eggs were not cooked properly as the whites were not fully done, resulting in slimy texture. Flavor profiles were good. Avocado toast was disgusting. Not only was it not toasted, but someone in the kitchen must have poured on lemon juice way too much. Soggy and lemony.\n\nPeople were nice enough, no complaints there.

There's so many choices on their menu, you can try so many different things. They offer smoothies, acai bowls, and traditional bowls. Their prices range from $7-$10, depending on your add-ons and toppings.\n\nThis is a great spot for college students and and a great on the go, to-go spot. There's only a few stools and a long table top to sit at, so there's not much room. I think the location was good, for those walking, but it was difficult to park. Staff was absolutely friendly and Monica, the cashier, was super helpful and nice!\n\nThey offer a lot of different toppings, such as: chocolate chips, peanut butter, coconut shavings, strawberries, bananas, blueberries, etc. They also offer a lot of supplement add-ins, such as: matcha green tea, immune support, brain wave, etc.\n\nGreat place to stop in and get something healthy and fresh!",

I was with a group of three, and it seemed like there was an issue with every order.\n\nFirst, staffing appeared to be minimal—only one person was behind the bar. We ordered drinks using the QR code, but one of the beers was incorrect. We had to take it back to the bar, where they corrected the mistake, but they mentioned the order printed incorrectly on their slip, even though our receipt showed the correct selection.\n\nOne person in our group ordered nachos, only to find the chips were stale. Another ordered mac and cheese and was looking forward to the pretzel stick that was supposed to come with it—but it was missing. When we finally spotted a server and asked, they initially said it didn’t come with one. We pointed out that both the menu description and pictures showed otherwise. After checking with the kitchen, they returned a few minutes later and simply said they were out of pretzels—without offering a replacement.\n\nI ordered a half-dozen wings, which took quite a while to arrive. When they finally did, there were only five. I flagged down a server, who mentioned it was her first day and wasn’t sure about the portion. After checking with the kitchen, she confirmed it should have been six. They offered to either bring out another wing or \"make things right\"—though it wasn’t clear what that meant. I opted for the extra wing, which took another 10 minutes to arrive. She then explained that the kitchen was training three new staff members, which likely contributed to the mistakes and delays.\n\nOverall, the service and food quality were disappointing. Additionally, since this is a pay-on-your-phone system, you have to tip before receiving your food or service. I prefer to tip based on my experience, so this felt like an odd approach.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend this place until they improve their staff training and overall operations.",

The Mac and cheese was freezing cold when it came out after 2 hours, and the waitress did not say a single thing and left our table and did not come back when we told her of this. When we finally flagged down another waitress, she said the service has been slow all week. No apologies nor reasoning. We all tipped very generously prior to receiving the food as this is required through the QR code, and when we said that we wouldn’t have waited nor tipped if we had known we had to wait 2 hours, we were told we should’ve gone up to the bar to check on the wait before ordering. We all individually had to go up to the manager to request refunds, and even then no workers seemed to really care that their service had been over 2 hours with no explanations or apologies.

They have an area to serve yourself water and offer a small variety of board games.\nI think overall it’s a nice place to maybe stop in have some drinks and share an appetizer but not necessarily have dinner since the menu is fairly limited.",

To test this place, I started off with a gimbap which looked exactly as advertised and tasted even better than it looked which was a bright green flag. This was perfect for moments when I don’t care about dining experience and want to put on a show while munching on comfort food, this hit the SPOT. Food was always prepared within promised time, I never had to wait.\n\nI’ve gotten this a few days ago and it’s been on my mind ever since. I got the dduk mandu soup this time and I was expected to be disappointed since it’s such a basic dish. However, this was so slap I know it’d hit even harder over the winter. I came for the dduk and stayed for the mandu. This was my first time having mandu and it looked different from what I’ve seen on the internet. The mandu was huge, the biggest dumplings I’ve ever had and also became the best I’ve had out of nowhere. Despite its size, the mandu was so tender it melted in my mouth, but firm enough to keep its shape. The flavor was sweet and so good, I couldn’t taste the distinctive meat taste to recognize which filling it was. The soup was so fragrant, this dish was easily a 10.\n\nI’ve never been so passionate about a review before, I will eat through the rest of the menu now. This small business deserves much love!",

The white bbq sauce is a winner.\n\nBrisket: 4/5 Very nice smoky flavor with nice bark. Some pieces were very fatty which was not great.\nChicken (leg quarter): 4/5 Again very nice smoky flavor and extremely well seasoned! The pieces we got were a little one the older side, not necessarily the freshest piece of smoked meat.\nCorn bread: 5/5 HIGHLY recommend. It was so good we had to go back to get a couple more pieces.

The inside is more bar like- no meat in sight. There were 2-3 smokers out front. They were a bit understaffed but our waitress was cordial and had us seat ourselves. Their brisket was good- soft and not dry but not much bark. Small portion but Would definitely recommend. Also tried their jalapeño cheese brat- middle of the road flavor wise. Sides of mac and cheese and collard greens were mediocre at best. Sweet tea was from a fountain- if your a BBQ place you should have good homemade tea. We did try their corn cakes topped with pulled pork and slaw- I would definitely recommend it if you’re looking for a good appetizer or extra dish.

I opted for a half serving of French toast with tea, while my friends ordered the Arnold, and some type of sandwich (pictured).

You can see in the picture the insane amount of cinnamon piled.\n\nMy group waited about 30 minutes for the check AFTER we got our plates cleared.

This local eatery serves Egypt’s beloved national dish—a hearty mix of rice, lentils, pasta, chickpeas, and crispy fried onions topped with tangy tomato sauce and optional spicy chili. The portions are generous, the flavors are well-balanced, and the food is served fresh. While the restaurant doesn’t have a fancy setting, it delivers exactly what you’d expect from a classic koshary spot: quick service, simple yet delicious food, and an authentic local vibe.\n\nHowever, like many casual dining places in Cairo, the overall cleanliness and maintenance of the area could be improved. The surroundings might feel a bit chaotic, and the streets often have litter, which takes away from the experience. But if you’re here for the food rather than the atmosphere, Koshary King won’t disappoint. It’s an ideal stop for travelers who want to taste real Egyptian street food without spending much. Just be prepared for a no-frills, local dining experience!",

I was hoping that the food would taste at least somewhat authentic, and I was looking forward to introducing my husband to tasty Egyptian food since I've raved about it so much.\n\nWe ordered the falafel sandwich and the koshary. Both dishes were nothing close to authentic and unfortunately neither was very enjoyable to eat. We were both disappointed.\n\nI'm so confused how the reviews are so amazing, including from some people that say they've eaten authentic Egyptian food. I've eaten food from an Egyptian restaurant in San Francisco, and while not exactly like street food in Egypt, the falafel was delicious.\n\nThis falafel was nothing close to the flavor and texture of an authentic Egyptian falafel sandwich. The falafels didn't have the traditional amazing mix of spices and pops of flavor (true Egyptian falafels are made with fava beans instead of chickpeas, and have a mix of many tasty spices, including fennel), the tahini had the texture and taste of hummus, but with way too much cumin, the pita tasted like a cheap store-bought kind, and the overall texture of the sandwich was mushy, including the tomatoes. The koshary noodles tasted overcooked and the flavor of the sauce and the whole dish wasn't great.\n\nThe owner seemed nice and looked Egyptian so I thought the food would taste authentic. I'm glad so many other people enjoy this restaurant so the owner can get good business, but I'll continue my search for an Egyptian restaurant so that hopefully one day I'll be able to introduce my husband to tasty and authentic Egyptian food.",

Merissa was our server and she went above and beyond to give us a great dining experience. She offered to take our children's order first so they didn't have to wait long on food and made sure we had everything we needed while dining. Even though we were the only customers seated outside at the time of our visit,  we never felt neglected and received friendly and excellent service. The food was delicious and I love being able to try a variety of things at a new place.  I had the Crunchweezy, Carne Asada, and Cantina Fish tacos. They were fairly large and after eating serve yourself chips and salsa as well as a shared order of queso I was unable to finish everything, though it was all fantastic.

Definitely well worth the 15 bucks charged. Amazing.  Our pizza was so good! I dreamed of it and then woke up and ate leftovers cold. Best house white pizza I’ve ever had thus far. We also had a hand tossed Pepp and cheese  ( I wanted to try both crust ). Wow!! The best Pepp and cheese I’ve had so far in Ohio . I didn’t even feed the Pepp’s to the dog or dip my crust in  ranch.  It was that good! Must try",

The crust is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and that was after it was delivered! Which I have yet to find with any other so-called pizza spot in Columbus! Anyone giving a bad review is just jealous. My favorite is the meat lovers. Very generous toppings on all of the pizzas. The main attraction is the Fried Chicken and THE GRAVY!! 10/10! I didn’t know that I needed the gravy until I had the gravy! Do not sleep on it. Auzy makes it himself. Let me not forget to mention the wings! My grandkids are addicted to the Honey Garlic Lemon Pepper wings. They arrived crunchy and juicy, full of flavor! Again, this was after it was delivered! I have been a fan of Ana Shawarma for a long time but now my family is addicted to Auzy’s and I have recommended my friends too. Also, Great customer service every time!",

One of the most unique dishes is the ginger pork chop, the flavor and breading were immaculate.  We came in on a lazy Sunday, place empty, dead afternoon hours... and recieved good service, and plate after plate of wonderfully cooked food, every dish as good as the last.  Impressive.\nThe spicy potato salad is fantastic, as is the spicy gizzard with cucumber salad.\nThe Chinese doughnuts are like fried air, unspeakably satisfying.\nGreat numbing sichuan pepper chile seasoning and spice on most all dishes.\n8.7/10 food, with a 9.5/10 being perfect\nAuthentic flavor and preparation, I recommend.",

He finally came out and took my order and brought me water as I requested. I ordered Lasagna which came with Garlic Bread. The bread was slightly burnt but was tasty. Ordered the Lasagna, a nice tomato taste which slightly chunky tomatoes in the sauce. One layer was made up of a huge square of ground beef. All in all it was a tasty meal.

We came in at 5pm and the service was extremely slow. The server missed up our table number so by the time the group after us was served our food still didn’t come up. As apology, they brought us two appetizers before we waited for our first order (that wasn’t an appetizer) to come. The flavor of food was okay, we were disappointed to find out the special lamb skewer was not hot when it was served to us. And the burning candle under the device wasn’t strong enough to warm up the lamb, we had to remove the plate and grill the lamb on actual but tiny flame! Hope they improve their speed at serving diners!",

Props to the folks running the spot! Opened the containers up when I got home and these wings were crispy and not dry, extra sauce sat at the bottom of the Togo box lined with aluminum foil so no leaks!! The extra step they took! The boneless wings were giving extra larger Chick-fil-A nuggets and let me tell you the honey garlic boneless dipped in the leftover sauce from the Carolina was topping me off! You should try the Mac nuggets dipped in that sauce too cause boy you need to get your ass down here and try these wings!",

I asked the manager if he would make it right since DoorDash isn’t going to and his repeated reply was for me to call DoorDash. No threats Were made I did say I was gonna leave a review and as a customer it’s my obligation to leave a review based on my most recent experience so that others know what to expect when a mistake is made at pizza fresca.

I like to sit at the tree, which doesn't have a lot of room as far as maybe eating a pizza, but is my favorite spot\n\nFood:\n\nCheese curds are generally good and come with a tangy dipping sauce. Veggie burger and fries taste was very good. I think the portion size was a little small for the price point, but with the cheese curd, I was full.\n\nBrews:\n\nThe sours (all 3 except horchata) were absolutely gorgeous.

The pumpkin pie is on oar with Prairies pumpkin pie treat (even better considering the price point, locally made, and the spices). The horchata didn't read as much horchata to me as it did cream soda flavoring, but it was still good.\n\nBought some to-go pumpkin sours!",

        "text": "This was my first time eating here, so I ordered several menu items. I ordered the #3 Bandeja Paisa, carnitas nachos, empanadas, tamales, Shrimp taco Supreme and chorizo taco supreme. The Carnitas nachos was by far the best of everything that I ordered, which is alarming because it literally causes for the least amount of skill or time to be put into it. Next, we have the empanadas which were stuffed with an appropriate amount of filling and fried perfectly, however someone forgot to put the salt in the empanada pastry and the filling which was bland as can be and was not satisfying even in the least. Next, we have the tamales which was prepared with way too much masa to filling ratio. I felt like I was just eating nothing but overly dense steamed masa and much like the empanadas had zero flavor to it whatsoever. And lastly, the shrimp and chorizo taco supreme. Fire starters, I got two chorizo taco Supremes instead of one shrimp and one chorizo so, there’s an issue right there of attention to detail. Along with that there was nothing spectacular about this taco. I mean, the presentation was misleading because it looked like a great taco but when I ate it, the chorizo was dry. It was not a good quality chorizo whatsoever. Just tasted like I was eating finely ground sausage with none of the spice mix that you expect in chorizo very disappointing. A piece of advice to this food truck, salt is not the enemy of great food. Furthermore, don’t put items on your menu that you do not have a qualified cook to prepare. It’s disappointing to your customers.",

My coworker ordered the orange chicken and it was so gross and mushy looking. She tried a bite and threw the rest out. Ordered egg rolls and one only got one roll. Definitely wouldn’t recommend.",

        "text": "Automatic gratuity for a party of 2 for mediocre service and ok food. The auto gratuity is 30% that they applied onto my bill without asking or having is posted anywhere. Is that just how they treat minority customers they assume won’t tip? Or just the usual? The orange chicken was good, Crab Rangoon was good but my half duck was luke warm and lacked flavor. Both white rice and brown rice were DIGUSTING. We came 2 hours before close and there was only 1 other table that was leaving and only 1 other table that came in while we were there; plus less than a handful of to go or Uber orders during our visit. The point is; they could have made our food ATLEAST hot. Woke up today browsing my bank statements and they also included an additional charge so my bill that was originally 67 ended up being 82 dollars altogether?? I’m not going to dispute it or call there because I’ve noticed some foreign owned franchises have some very shady practices but I Will obviously never return. Just a heads up to someone who may be attracted to this scummy place by the initial nice decor of the restaurant.",

After sitting down I was greeted by Nick the bartender. Decided to order the Chili and the Italian Sub. The chili had a nice blend of beans, hamburger, tomatoes, onions, peppers and spices. It had just a slight kick to it which was just right. No wonder why it is listed as one of the best in town. On to the sub sandwich. It has hard salami, hot ham, provolone cheese, lettuce, onion, tomatoes, banana peppers and Italian dressing on I believe an Auddino's bun that seemed to been pressed by a Panini Press to heat it up and to melt the cheese. It made for a phenomenal sandwich. Nick checked on me numerous times and refilled my drink. Well everything I read about this place was true. Their food is off the chart. Check them out.",
